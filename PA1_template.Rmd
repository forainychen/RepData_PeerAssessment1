# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r}
data <- read.csv(file="activity.csv",head=TRUE,sep=",")
total_steps <- tapply(data$steps, data$date, FUN=sum)
total_steps
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

```{r}
hist(total_steps, breaks=10)
```

The mean of total number of steps each day
```{r}
mean(total_steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```

The median of total number of steps each day
```{r}
median(total_steps, na.rm=TRUE)
summary(total_steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
